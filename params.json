{"name":"Roomba-Soar","tagline":"Control an iRobot Roomba 595 with a Soar agent running under a Jsoar kernel.","body":"Roomba-Soar\r\n===========\r\n\r\nControl an [iRobot Roomba](http://www.irobot.com) 595 with a\r\n[Soar](http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar/home) agent running under a\r\n[Jsoar](https://github.com/soartech/jsoar) kernel.\r\n\r\nThe kernel and a Roomba interface layer run under Java on a host\r\nmachine. The host might be a netbook mounted on the Roomba, or as in\r\nthe photograph below, a desktop connected via WiFi.\r\n\r\n![](www/media/RoombaSoar.jpg)\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the system, a trivial obstacle avoiding agent has been\r\ndeveloped ([video](http://youtu.be/_xIfJ1AbCM4)).\r\n\r\nHardware Requirements\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nThe hardware requirements, along with approximate costs, are shown in\r\nthe [system diagram](www/media/Roomba-SoarSystemDiagram.pdf).\r\n\r\n![](www/media/Roomba-SoarSystemDiagram.png)\r\n\r\nNote that for a system with the host mounted on the Roomba (e.g. using\r\na netbook), the Wireless USB Sharing Station is not required and the\r\nhost is connected directly to the Roomba via the FTDI Cable and Custom\r\nData Cable.\r\n\r\nSoftware\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThe software, including the latest version of the Roomba interface\r\nlayer, is provided in the [TableCircumnavigator](TableCircumnavigator)\r\n(obstacle avoiding) example. A brief overview is provided below. More details can be found in the [Javadoc](TableCircumnavigator/dist/javadoc/index.html).\r\n\r\nThe [RoombaIF](TableCircumnavigator/dist/javadoc/roombaif/package-summary.html)\r\nabstract base class provides methods to open and close a connection to\r\nthe Roomba and a mechanism to request the Roomba stream any subset of\r\nits sensor data. (The sensors are described in the\r\n[iRobot Roomba 500 Open Interface (OI) Specification](www/iRobot_Roomba_500_Open_Interface_Spec.pdf)). Methods\r\nto issue motor commands are available and it should be straightforward\r\nto add new methods for other commands.\r\n\r\nTwo implementations of the RoombaIF class are included: one that uses\r\nthe\r\n[Java Simple Serial Connector](https://github.com/scream3r/java-simple-serial-connector)\r\nto establish a connection with an actual Roomba; and one that\r\ndemonstrates a trivial simulated Roomba.\r\n\r\n[TableCircumnavigator.java](TableCircumnavigator/src/tablecircumnavigator/TableCircumnavigator.java)\r\ndemonstates how to use JSoar SoarBeans to receive output commands from\r\nthe agent's I/O link and JSoar Quick Input to send sensor data to the\r\nI/O link.\r\n\r\nThe TableCircumnavigator\r\n[Soar agent](TableCircumnavigator/soar/table-circumnavigator.soar)\r\nmerely moves the Roomba forward slowly until it is obstructed, pivots\r\nclockwise until the obstruction is cleared, and continues moving\r\nforwards.\r\n \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
